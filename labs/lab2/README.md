# Lab 2: Gradient Descent and The Perceptron

In this lab session, you will gain practical knowledge on gradient descent and the perceptron algorithm.

The lab is divided into two parts:

1. [Part 1: Solving Logistic Regression](./lr/log_reg_solver.ipynb)
2. [Part 2: The Perceptron](./perceptron/perceptron.ipynb)
