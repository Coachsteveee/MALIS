# Setup

This tutorial is designed to get set and running with Git and your local Python environment. It will give you the basics to start working with Jupyter notebooks.

The tutorial contains three parts:

1. [Using Git and Git repositories](./git.md)
2. Setting a local Python environment
3. Working with Jupyter Notebooks and Jupyter Lab

Once you have gone through all the steps of the tutorial, run the check_setup.ipynb notebook to verify that your environment has been correctly configured.
